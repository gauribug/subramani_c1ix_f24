        >My idea of femininity changes all the time. Different eras of my life defines it in different ways. As a kid I wanted to be different and forced myself to be the kind of person who did not like pink. Over time I have had to slowly accept pink back into my life without diminishing how I feel about it. This might all feel like a stupid little rant, but I truly believe that my perception of femininity and the color pink actually tells more about myself than what meets the eye.
